	<p>I am a junior at the University of Rochester majoring in statistics with minors in computer science and mathematics. On campus, I am a member of the men’s swimming and diving team, on which I swim sprint freestyle. Additionally, I work as a lifeguard at the athletic center.</p>

			<h3>Early Days</h3>
			<p>I was born in Orlando, Florida on August 14, 1998 and have two siblings, an older brother and a younger sister. After about three years in Florida, my family moved to Lindfield, New South Wales, Australia due to my father’s work. Although I was quite young for my entire time in Australia, it provided some very happy memories nonetheless and will always hold a special place in my heart. I remained overseas until my father’s job caused us to move back to the United States after about four years in Lindfield. We eventually settled in the small town of Lansing, New York, which I am fortunate enough to call my home currently.</p>
			<h3>Academic Interests</h3>
			<p>When I started school at the University of Rochester, I was undecided as to the major I wanted to pursue but was initially interested in the field of biology. However, after taking a few introductory courses my first semester, I realized that biology was not the subject for me. After a brief period of interest in majoring in data science (CSC 172 quickly made me change my mind), I settled on statistics due to my general interest in the subject from high school.</p>

		

		<h3>Courses</h3>
		<p>In regard to courses I have taken, I would say that the hardest class I have taken in college is easily MTH 235 (linear algebra). I did not have any prior experience with proof-based math classes, so that combined with the very difficult subject matter made for an unpleasant experience. My favorite class that I have taken so far would have to be either STT 216 or BCS 260, for pretty different reasons. I enjoyed STT 216 primarily because of the practicality of the content we learned. It seemed very applicable to real life situations, especially since I am a statistics major and will be using these skills quite often. BCS 260 was fun mainly because it dealt with topics that were both interesting and quite different from what I was used to, which combined to make an exciting experience.</p>

		<h3>Sports Background</h3>
		<p>Throughout elementary and middle school, I was very into playing soccer, spending most of my time outside of the classroom playing for my school or club teams. In the seventh grade, however, I was introduced to the sport of swimming, although thrown into the deep end is probably a more accurate description. Due to the size of our school, we did not have a middle school swim team, so in order to participate in swim with my brother, I had to join the varsity team as a very small seventh grader. I immediately fell in love with the sport, and eventually stopped playing soccer to exclusively swim. I swam a lot throughout high school and made many great friends as a result. Additionally, I was introduced to statistics through my course work in high school and became very interested in the subject, which influenced my major choice when I got to college.</p>
