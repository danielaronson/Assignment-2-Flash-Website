		<h2>Work</h2>

		<p>

		After my sophomore year of college, I began working for a company called Marathon Engineering & Environmental Services, which was a civil and environmental engineering firm. I interned there for a summer. My work consisted of assisting surveyors with various duties. This included both elevation mapping of a work cite and wetlands mapping. This work often meant trekking through the woods on 100 degree days with a machete trying to map wetland boundaries. After my Junior year of college, I secured an internship with Wegmanâ€™s as a member of their design services team. This meant that I assisted with any engineering work that went on within the stores themselves. I helped plan new Solar Panel Systems for their stores, helped plan circuitry layout for some of their displays, and assisted in designing a new Condenser screen, among many other things. After graduation, I will be working for Lockheed Martin and pursuing a Graduate Degree in Mechanical Engineering. My program will allow me to work in various different roles within the company. This will allow me to gain expertise in different fields before I eventually settle into one role.
