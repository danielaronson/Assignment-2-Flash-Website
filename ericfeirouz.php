	<h2> Before U of R</h2>

	<p>
	I am currently a senior at the University of Rochester. I grew up in Acton, Massachusetts, a small town right outside of Boston. I have a sibling who is currently in 7th grade. Before college, I enjoyed playing video games, watching movies and playing sports with my friends. During my senior year of highschool, not having a particular major in mind, I chose to attend the University of Rochester due to how well rounded all of its programs are. On top of this, there was a spot for me on the swim team. I have been a competitive swimmer since I was 8 years old, so swimming was a big part of the decision to attend here. I was also used to heavy winters, so I did not let the Rochester weather deter me from committing here.

	<h2> Computer Science Minor</h2>
	<p>
	When deciding on my major I was torn between Engineering and Computer Science. I was intrigued by engineering due to my deep interest in physics in high school. However, I knew computer science was a fascinating major as it required a substantial amount of logic and creativity. It took me 2 semesters to finalize on mechanical engineering, but I made sure to pursue a minor in computer science due to the fun I had in previous coding course I had taken. At the University of Rochester, I have taken: Intro to Programming, Data Structures, Web Design and Development and Statistical Programming. This semester I am taking Advanced Web Design and Robot Construction.
	</p>

	<h2> Mechanical Engineering Major</h2>
	<p>
	In regards to engineering coursework, I have loved the hands on experience I have gotten from my mechanical design class. I also enjoyed fluid dynamics and thermodynamics. For engineering internships, I spent the summer of 2017 in Rochester working for Nalco Water. This was a client facing role that involved working with various heating plants in the upstate New York area. I worked the summer of 2018 in Vermont for Keurig Dr Pepper as a Quality Engineering Intern. I worked on an engineering project, and was also able to work on a side project that involved SQL and Databases. I was able to work on the side project after expressing my interest in coding and big data. I thoroughly enjoyed my internship this summer. I also loved living in Burlington, Vermont. I had 4 other roommates that are all seniors at the University of Vermont. Over the summer, I frequently visited lake champlain and ate at all the great restaurants Burlington has to offer. Best of all, I received a lot of free coffee from Keurig.

	<h2> Plans After College</h2>
	<p>
	For my senior spring semester, I hope to explore Rochester as much as I can before I graduate. After graduation, I will be working as an analyst for Deloitte in the Washington D.C area. I will hope to traveland visit places that I have never visited before and spend time with my family before I move to D.C. I look forward to see what the next few years have in store for me!
