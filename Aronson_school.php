		<h2>School</h2>

		<p>

		My favorite classes in college so far have been Thermodynamics, Heat Transfer and Material Science. My least favorite class in college was Electricity & Magnetism. For my senior design project this spring, my group and I will be doing athletic helmet testing. We will develop a new testing system which will help researchers try to limit brain injuries in contact sports like football or boxing.
