		<h2>Courses</h2>
		<p>In regard to courses I have taken, I would say that the hardest class I have taken in college is easily MTH 235 (linear algebra). I did not have any prior experience with proof-based math classes, so that combined with the very difficult subject matter made for an unpleasant experience. My favorite class that I have taken so far would have to be either STT 216 or BCS 260, for pretty different reasons. I enjoyed STT 216 primarily because of the practicality of the content we learned. It seemed very applicable to real life situations, especially since I am a statistics major and will be using these skills quite often. BCS 260 was fun mainly because it dealt with topics that were both interesting and quite different from what I was used to, which combined to make an exciting experience.</p>
