		<h2>Early Days</h2>

		<p>

		I was born in Cherry Hill, New Jersey in 1997. I have two sisters, one older and one younger. I went to Johnson Elementary School, then Rosa Middle School, and then Cherry Hill East High School. During the summers, I would swim at Charleston swim club, a neighborhood pool close to my house, and began life guarding there when I was old enough.

		When I was younger, I was interested in athletics and participated in every sport possible. I eventually weeded down my athletic interests to baseball and swimming. I learned to play the guitar, but just as quickly forgot everything that I learned after stopping lessons. In school, I had an interest in STEM courses from the start, although my high school did not offer many courses (or any) in computer sciences. Despite this, I decided to pursue a Computer Science minor after a few years in college. I decided to study Mechanical Engineering in college because of my interest in STEM classes, especially Physics.
