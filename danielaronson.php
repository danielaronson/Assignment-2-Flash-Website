		<p>I am a senior at the University of Rochester majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. At the University, I am a member of the men’s varsity Swimming and Diving team. I have been a captain of the team for the past two years and compete in sprint freestyle events. I am also a member of the school’s Varsity Student Athlete Advisory Committee (VSAAC). Outside of these activities, I enjoy playing Xbox and golfing. </p>

		<h2>Early Days</h2>

		<p>

		I was born in Cherry Hill, New Jersey in 1997. I have two sisters, one older and one younger. I went to Johnson Elementary School, then Rosa Middle School, and then Cherry Hill East High School. During the summers, I would swim at Charleston swim club, a neighborhood pool close to my house, and began life guarding there when I was old enough.

		When I was younger, I was interested in athletics and participated in every sport possible. I eventually weeded down my athletic interests to baseball and swimming. I learned to play the guitar, but just as quickly forgot everything that I learned after stopping lessons. In school, I had an interest in STEM courses from the start, although my high school did not offer many courses (or any) in computer sciences. Despite this, I decided to pursue a Computer Science minor after a few years in college. I decided to study Mechanical Engineering in college because of my interest in STEM classes, especially Physics.

		<h2>School</h2>

		<p>

		My favorite classes in college so far have been Thermodynamics, Heat Transfer and Material Science. My least favorite class in college was Electricity & Magnetism. For my senior design project this spring, my group and I will be doing athletic helmet testing. We will develop a new testing system which will help researchers try to limit brain injuries in contact sports like football or boxing.

		<h2>Work</h2>

		<p>

		After my sophomore year of college, I began working for a company called Marathon Engineering & Environmental Services, which was a civil and environmental engineering firm. I interned there for a summer. My work consisted of assisting surveyors with various duties. This included both elevation mapping of a work cite and wetlands mapping. This work often meant trekking through the woods on 100 degree days with a machete trying to map wetland boundaries. After my Junior year of college, I secured an internship with Wegman’s as a member of their design services team. This meant that I assisted with any engineering work that went on within the stores themselves. I helped plan new Solar Panel Systems for their stores, helped plan circuitry layout for some of their displays, and assisted in designing a new Condenser screen, among many other things. After graduation, I will be working for Lockheed Martin and pursuing a Graduate Degree in Mechanical Engineering. My program will allow me to work in various different roles within the company. This will allow me to gain expertise in different fields before I eventually settle into one role.
