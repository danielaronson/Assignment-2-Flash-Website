		<p>

		I am a senior at the University of Rochester majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. At the University, I am a member of the men’s varsity Swimming and Diving team. I have been a captain of the team for the past two years and compete in sprint freestyle events. I am also a member of the school’s Varsity Student Athlete Advisory Committee (VSAAC). Outside of these activities, I enjoy playing Xbox and golfing.
