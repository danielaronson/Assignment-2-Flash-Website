		<h2>Academic Interests</h2>
		<p>When I started school at the University of Rochester, I was undecided as to the major I wanted to pursue but was initially interested in the field of biology. However, after taking a few introductory courses my first semester, I realized that biology was not the subject for me. After a brief period of interest in majoring in data science (CSC 172 quickly made me change my mind), I settled on statistics due to my general interest in the subject from high school.</p>
