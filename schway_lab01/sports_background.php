		<h2>Sports Background</h2>
		<p>Throughout elementary and middle school, I was very into playing soccer, spending most of my time outside of the classroom playing for my school or club teams. In the seventh grade, however, I was introduced to the sport of swimming, although thrown into the deep end is probably a more accurate description. Due to the size of our school, we did not have a middle school swim team, so in order to participate in swim with my brother, I had to join the varsity team as a very small seventh grader. I immediately fell in love with the sport, and eventually stopped playing soccer to exclusively swim. I swam a lot throughout high school and made many great friends as a result. Additionally, I was introduced to statistics through my course work in high school and became very interested in the subject, which influenced my major choice when I got to college.</p>
